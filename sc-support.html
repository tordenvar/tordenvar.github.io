        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>How many levels are there?</h2>
        <p>
            There are currently 1500 levels across 10 different stages! Spell Champ is continuously updated, so check back for updates!
        </p>

        <h2>Are there duplicate words?</h2>
        <p>
            To the best of our knowledge, each stage has a unique word. Some stages have different forms of a word (i.e. separate and separately),
            but there should be no exact duplicates. If there are, please let us know at tordenvarapps@gmail.com!
        </p>

        <h2>There is a word spelled incorrectly. What can I do?</h2>
        <p>
            Keep in mind every word is spelled in the American-English variation (as opposed to British-English). If a word is misspelled,
            please shoot us an email at tordenvarapps@gmail.com and we will do our very best to fix it ASAP.
        </p>

        <h2>I have a business inquiry and I would love to get in contact, how can I do that?</h2>
