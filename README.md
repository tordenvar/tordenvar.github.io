# Pass The Trivia


## FAQ

### How are the points calculated?
```markdown
If the question is answered correctly within the first 3 seconds, then the player is awarded with the full 25 points possible. If the player takes longer to answer but still gets it correctly, the player gets as many points as there are seconds left on the timer. If the player answers the question incorrectly or runs out of time, then no points are awarded. More game modes/point calculations are to be added in versions following 1.0.
```

### What is the system to determine a tiebreaker?
```markdown
Currently, a tiebreaker between two players is determined by a pseudo-random calculation.
```

### Why can't I start a game with more than 6 players?
```markdown
Pass The Trivia currently only supports gameplay for up to 6 players at a time.
```

### Why can't I start a game with more than 20 rounds?
```markdown
Games more than 20 rounds were found to be drawn out and lethargic during the post-release testing phase, so currently the amount of rounds must be between 0 and 20.
```

### There is a bug and the game is not functioning correctly.
